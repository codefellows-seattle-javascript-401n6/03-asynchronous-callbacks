# Project: CF 401 Lab 03 Asynchronous Callbacks

## By Ryan Johnson

### Project Description
The reader.js file will take in multiple data components from a user and return the result to the user in the same manner requested though the code will request and return data asynchronously.

///
In your README.md describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's arity (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to write any additional information in your README.md.
