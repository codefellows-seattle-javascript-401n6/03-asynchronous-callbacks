That Annoying Song
It plays again filling me with dread
it's melody plays like a jackhammer in my head 
I just want to run and get away from
that annoying song
Worse yet it seems to play everywhere I go
that annoying song
The lyrics make me feel sick
I want to throw a brick at 
that annoying song
After hearing it all day, it plays through my mind
like an uninvited pest
it is disturbing my rest
that annoying song
It plays through my mind as I lay in my bed
I can not seem to get it out of my head
I  can not seem to control my feet that tap to the beat of
that annoying song
